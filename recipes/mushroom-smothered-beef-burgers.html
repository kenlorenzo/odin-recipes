    <p>There's nothing more satisfying and delicious than these tasty, quick-cooking, beef burgers served with a creamy mushroom gravy.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>⅓ cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups sliced mushrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Thoroughly mix 1/4 cup soup, beef, bread crumbs, onion and egg in a large bowl. Shape the beef mixture firmly into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) burgers.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the burgers and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining soup, Worcestershire, water and mushrooms to the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the burgers are cooked through.</li>
